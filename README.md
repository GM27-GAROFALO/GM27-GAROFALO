👋 Hi, I'm GIOVANNI MANLIO GAROFALO
🎓 Data Scientist | Data Analyst | Statistician | Economist

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m passionate about transforming data into actionable insights through advanced statistical models, machine learning techniques, and financial analysis. With a solid background in statistics, Big Data, financial risk management, and economics, I aim to solve complex problems in both the academic and business worlds.

🚀 About Me: 
I hold an academic foundation that bridges the gap between statistical analysis, finance, and data science, with hands-on experience in:

Credit Scoring: Applying Probit Regression Analysis, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and ROC curves to develop models that assess credit risk for businesses.
Risk Management: Expertise in evaluating probability of default using the Merton Model and the KMV approach for credit risk. Skilled in Value at Risk (VaR) analysis, backtesting, and running simulations (historical and Monte Carlo) for portfolio risk assessment.
Financial Forecasting: Utilizing the CAPM regression model to predict asset returns and risk, and developing both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts.
Time Series Analysis: Advanced knowledge of ARIMA and GARCH models for financial data, along with techniques like TRAMO SEATS for seasonal adjustment.
Stochastic Processes: Solid foundation in processes like Brownian motion, martingales, and Ito's Calculus, essential for modeling uncertainty in financial markets.
💡 What I Do
🔍 Big Data & Machine Learning: I’m adept at working with Big Data, using machine learning algorithms for classification and predictive analytics. From data mining to visualization, I enjoy uncovering hidden patterns and trends in large datasets.

📊 Statistical Modeling: With a deep understanding of Bayesian and non-parametric statistics, I’m equipped to handle a wide range of analytical tasks, from classical hypothesis testing to more advanced techniques. I have also applied statistical models for clinical trials and healthcare analytics.

🛠️ Tools I Use:

Languages: R, Python, MatLab
Database Management: MySQL, Microsoft Access
Big Data & Visualization: Advanced proficiency in R for data manipulation and visualization, with experience in machine learning and statistical algorithms.
Statistical Software: Proficient in R and Six Sigma for quality control and process optimization.
📈 Financial & Economic Analysis
Having completed various projects and coursework in areas like Scienza delle Finanze and Statistical Methods for Financial Markets, I possess robust knowledge of financial markets, accounting principles, and balance sheet analysis. I’m also well-versed in the legal frameworks around corporate competition, thanks to my studies in European and national competition law.

🛠 Ongoing Learning & Projects
I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and skills, especially in:

Portfolio Management: Exploring advanced methods like Backtesting and refining my knowledge of Risk Management techniques.
Time Series & Financial Models: Continually developing my expertise in ARIMA, GARCH, and stochastic models for more accurate financial forecasting.
Machine Learning for Finance: Applying ML models to financial datasets, from credit scoring to algorithmic trading.
🌱 Let's Connect
I’m always open to collaborating on projects related to data science, finance, and machine learning. Let’s work together to build something amazing!
